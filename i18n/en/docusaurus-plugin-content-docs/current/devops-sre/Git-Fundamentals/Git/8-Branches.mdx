## What is a branch?

A **branch** is an independent line of development in Git.

You create a branch when you want to:
- Work on new features
- Fix bugs safely
- Maintain an older release
- Experiment without breaking main code

The default branch is usually called **main**.

---

## Why use branches?

Common real-world scenarios

- **Maintenance branch**
  - Fix bugs
  - Improve performance
  - Patch security issues

- **Development branch**
  - Add new features
  - Make breaking changes
  - Prepare for the next major release

- **Bug-fix or experiment branch**
  - Isolate risky work
  - Avoid conflicts with other changes

Branches let multiple efforts move forward **at the same time**.

#### Why Git branches are powerful

- Creating a branch is fast
- Switching branches is fast
- Merging branches is easy
- All branches are technically equal

Even the Linux kernel uses **many parallel branches**.
The main branch (maintained by Linus Torvalds) is socially important,
but technically no different from other branches.

<br/>
#### One active branch at a time

You can have many branches in a repository, but:
- Only **one branch is active**
- Your working files always match the active branch
- Switching branches changes the files on disk

---

## Branch names vs tags
### Branches
- Represent an **ongoing line of development**
- Move forward as new commits are added
- Examples: `main`, `devel`, `stable`, `debug`

### Tags
- Represent a **fixed point in history**
- Do NOT move
- Should never change
- Examples: `v1.0`, `v2.4.1`

Think of it this way:
- Branch = moving pointer
- Tag = permanent bookmark

---

## Creating a branch

#### Basic command

```
git branch <branch_name> [starting_point]
```

#### Example: create a development branch

```
git branch devel
```

This creates a new branch from the current commit.

---

## List branches

```
git branch
```

The current branch is marked with `*`.

For more detailed history:

```
git show-branch
```

---

## Deleting a branch

```
git branch -d devel
```

:::warning
You cannot delete the branch you are currently on.  
Recovering deleted branches is hard — be careful.

## Switching branches (checkout)

To switch to another branch:

```
git checkout devel
```

- Files change to match the branch
- HEAD moves to the latest commit of that branch
- No data is lost

To go back:

```
git checkout main
```

---

## Create and switch branch in one step

```
git checkout -b newbranch startpoint
```

This is the same as:

```
git branch newbranch startpoint
git checkout newbranch
```

<br/>
#### Important safety note

If you have **uncommitted changes**, Git may refuse to switch branches.
This prevents you from accidentally losing work.

---

## Example: files differ across branches

```
git branch devel
echo hello > hello
git add hello
git commit -m "add hello file"
git checkout devel
```

The file `hello` will NOT exist in `devel` because it was created after branching.

---

## Getting an earlier version of a file

### View an old version

```
git show v2.4.1:src/myfile.c
```

(Note the `:`)

---

### Restore an old version

```
git checkout v2.4.1 src/myfile.c
```

(No colon here)

:::info Summary
- Branches let you work independently and safely
- Only one branch is active at a time
- Branches move, tags do not
- Creating and switching branches is fast
- Essential for professional Git workflows
