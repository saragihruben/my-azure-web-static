## What is Git ?

Git is a distributed **Revision Control System**. Such systems helps developers safely manage, track, and restore changes in code during software development. 
When more than one developer is involved, revision control systems provide a workflow for cooperative development and reconciliation of conflicting contributions.

## Revision System Control

Revision System Control (also called Version Control) is a tool that helps developers track changes in their code over time.

## Why it is needed

#### - When working on a project, code changes often:
- Bugs are fixed
- New features are added
- Code is improved

#### - Sometimes a change breaks the program
#### - Revision control lets you go back to an earlier working version and fix the problem

<br/>
### Problems without revision control
- You may not know when or where a bug was introduced
- Manual backups (copy-paste folders) are messy and hard to manage
- Comparing old and new code becomes difficult
- Tracking who changed what is almost impossible

<br/>
### What revision control does
#### - Saves a history of changes instead of full copies
#### - Allows you to:
- See what changed
- See who made the change
- Restore older versions of code

#### -Saves disk space and time
#### -Makes debugging easier

Importance in teamwork and open-source projects
- Shows who contributed each part of the code
- Helps identify experts for specific features
- Tracks legal ownership of code to avoid license problems
- Makes collaboration safer and more organized
