## What does “diff” mean?

**Diffing** means comparing two versions of something to see:
- What changed
- What was added
- What was removed

This can be done with:
- Regular UNIX tools (`diff`)
- Git commands (`git diff`)

#### Using the UNIX `diff` command

The standard UNIX `diff` command compares:
- Two files
- Or two directories (recursively)

### Simple file comparison

Suppose:

**file1**
```
This is the contents of a simple file.
```

**file2**
```
This is the contents of a slightly different file.
```

Run:

```
diff file1 file2
```

Example output:
```
2,3c2,3
< contents
< of a simple
---
> contents of a slightly
> different
```

This output is correct, but not very easy to read.

### Unified diff (recommended)

Most people use the **unified diff** format with `-u`:

```
diff -u file1 file2
```

Example output:
```diff
--- file1
+++ file2
@@ -1,4 +1,4 @@
 This is the
-contents
-of a simple
+contents of a slightly
+different
 file.
```
### How to read unified diff output

- `---` → original file
- `+++` → new file
- `@@` → line number context
- `-` → line removed
- `+` → line added
- No symbol → unchanged context

This format is also used by **patch tools**.

## Diffing directories

To compare two directory trees:

```
diff -Nur directory1 directory2
```

#### Common options explained
- `-r` → recursive (check subdirectories)
- `-N` → show added or deleted files
- `-u` → unified output

This is useful when comparing two project folders.

## Diffing with Git

Git provides more powerful and convenient diff tools.

### Basic Git diff

```
git diff
```

Shows differences between:
- Your working directory
- The last commit (HEAD)


### Compare working directory with a commit

```
git diff earlier_commit
```

Compares your current files with a specific commit or branch.

### Compare staged changes

```
git diff --cached
```

or (more intuitive):

```
git diff --staged
```

Shows what is **staged** and will go into the next commit.

You can also compare staged changes to a commit:

```
git diff --cached earlier_commit
```

### Compare two commits

```
git diff commit1 commit2
```

Shows exactly what changed between two commits.

### Useful Git diff options

- Ignore whitespace:
```
git diff --ignore-all-space
```

- Show summary statistics:
```
git diff --stat
```

- Show numeric statistics:
```
git diff --numstat
```

### Limit diff to part of a project

You can focus on a specific directory.

Example (Linux kernel repo):

```
git diff v4.2.1 v4.2.2 Documentation/vm
```

Only shows changes inside `Documentation/vm`.

### Show stats for a subdirectory

```
git diff --stat v4.2.1 v4.2.2 arch/x86_64
```

Shows a brief summary instead of full diffs.

:::info Summary

- `diff` compares files or directories
- `diff -u` gives readable, standard output
- `git diff` is more powerful and Git-aware
- You can compare working files, staged files, commits, or directories
- Essential for reviewing changes before committing
