## File Categories in Git

Git classifies files in your project into three categories.

### Tracked Files

Tracked files are files that Git already knows about.

These files:
- Were committed in the past, or
- Have been changed and staged using `git add`

Examples include:
- Source code files
- Configuration files already stored in the repository

Git actively monitors these files for changes.

### Ignored Files

Ignored files are files that Git is instructed to completely ignore.

Ignored files:
- Do not appear in `git status`
- Are listed in a `.gitignore` file

Common ignored files include:
- Build outputs
- Temporary files
- Log files

Example `.gitignore` file:

```text
*.o
*.log
```

This configuration tells Git to ignore all `.o` and `.log` files.

#### Overriding Ignore Rules

Ignore rules can be overridden using an exclamation mark (`!`).

Example:

```text
*.ko
!my_driver.ko
```

This means:
- Ignore all `.ko` files
- Except `my_driver.ko`

### Untracked Files

Untracked files are files that Git sees but does not track yet.

These files:
- Exist in the working directory
- Are not ignored
- Have not been added using `git add`

Once you add an untracked file with `git add`, it becomes a tracked file.

#### File Status Summary

| File Type   | Git Behavior                          |
|------------|----------------------------------------|
| Tracked    | Git tracks and records changes          |
| Ignored    | Git completely ignores the file         |
| Untracked  | Git sees the file but does not track it |

## Basic File Commands

### git add

The `git add` command stages files for the next commit.

What it does:
- Adds new files
- Stages modified files
- Does not save changes permanently

Example:

```
git add myfile.txt
```

Useful options:
- `git add .` stages all files
- `git add -u` stages only tracked files
- `git add -i` allows interactive staging

Changes are only staged and are not part of the repository history until you commit them.

### git rm

The `git rm` command removes a file and stages its deletion.

Important points:
- Removes the file from the working directory
- Stages the removal
- Does not erase the file from Git history

Example:

```
git rm myfile.txt
```

#### Remove from Git but Keep the File Locally

```
git rm --cached myfile.txt
```

This is useful if:
- A file was added by mistake
- You want Git to stop tracking the file

### git mv

The `git mv` command renames or moves a file and stages the change.

Example:

```
git mv oldfile.txt newfile.txt
```

This is equivalent to:

```
mv oldfile.txt newfile.txt
git rm oldfile.txt
git add newfile.txt
```

Git handles renaming efficiently because it tracks file content, not filenames.

#### Effect of File Commands

| Command   | Working Directory | Staging Area | Commit History |
|----------|-------------------|--------------|----------------|
| git add  | No change         | Updated      | No change      |
| git rm   | File removed      | Updated      | No change      |
| git mv   | File renamed      | Updated      | No change      |

The commit history changes only after running `git commit`.

## Listing Files in Git

### git ls-files

The `git ls-files` command shows files tracked by Git.

```
git ls-files
```

---

### Show Untracked Files

```
git ls-files --others --exclude-standard
```

- `--others` shows untracked files
- `--exclude-standard` respects `.gitignore` rules

---

:::info Summary

Git classifies files as tracked, ignored, or untracked.
Commands like `git add`, `git rm`, and `git mv` control which files are staged and later committed to the repository.
