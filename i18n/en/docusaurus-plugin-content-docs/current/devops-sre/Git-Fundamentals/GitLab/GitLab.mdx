GitLab brings the complete DevSecOps lifecycle into a single comprehensive platform. 
It includes everything from Source Code Management, CI/CD, Integrated Security, and much more to meet all of your development requirements.

## What is GitLab ? 

GitLab is a git-based completely integrated DevSecOps platform for the complete software development lifecycle.
As a single DevSecOps Platform, GitLab provides a single application with features and capabilities that support organizations across the entire DevOps lifecycle.

## Why GitLab ? 

The SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle) is complex. And as your organization's SDLC matures, your toolchain complexity increases to support each stage of the SDLC. 
Historically, as needs evolve, organizations will identify one preferred tool for each function leading to a system of disparate tools typically held together with "digital 
duct tape" and manual processes Which often lead to:

- Redundant and incompatible tools
- Data and process silos
- No alignment among teams
- No consistent application security or compliance
- No consistent traceability
- A high degree of context switching

For example, when approaching a software project, Developers need to consider tools for:

- Project planning
- Source Code Management
- Continuous Integration
- Infrastructure configuration
- Incident Monitoring
- Application Security
- Compliance Assurance

To that end, GitLab fundamentally changes the way that organizations approach DevSecOps.
GitLab offers a Single DevSecOps Platform in which a single application with a logical set of DevSecOps capabilities replaces the overhead and confusion of disparate 
DevSecOps tools and provides visibility, control, and collaboration through all parts of the DevSecOps lifecycle.

## GitLab Features and Benefits

#### Better Insights
End-to-end visibility across the complete software delivery lifecycle (SDLC)

#### Greater Efficiency
Built-in support for automation and integrations with third-party services

#### Improved collaboration
One workflow that unites developer, security, and ops teams

#### Faster time to value
Continuous improvement through accelerated feedback loops

#### Ease of adoption
Integrates with your existing toolchain; adopt at your own pace

#### Security 
Security is built in and integrated throughout the complete SDLC

#### Compliance
Comprehensive governance solutions allowing separation of duties and compliance assurance between teams

## Who Uses GitLab ?

As stated previously, GitLab is a Single DevSecOps Platform - But what does that actually mean for your Team Members?

GitLab's goal is to empower all of your Teams - Software, Operations, IT, Security, and Business - to collaboratively plan, build, secure, deploy and monitor 
software across an end-to-end unified system.

| **Product Manager/Designers** | Product Managers can use the GitLab Planning features for team planning, portfolio management, requirements management, quality management, and design management. They can also output DORA metrics, DevOps reports, and leverage the GitLab Wiki and Pages for documentation. |
| **Developers**                | Developers can use the GitLab Create and Verify features for source code management, code review workflow, and remote development, as well as continuous integration (CI) and code testing and coverage.                                      |
| **Security Teams**            | Security Teams can use the GitLab Package and Secure features to maintain a package and container registry and to enforce security and compliance policies consistently across application development. They also have full oversight on the security posture of a project or group of projects and can triage and manage vulnerabilities. |
| **Operations Teams**          | Operations Teams can use the GitLab Monitoring features for incident management, environment management, deployment management, and feature flags.                                                                                          |
| **Compliance Managers**       | Compliance Managers can use the GitLab Compliance Features for dependency, vulnerability, and compliance management.                                                                                                                        |
