---

As software security becomes increasingly important, many companies want to introduce standard code scanning processes into development workflows to find and remediate 
security vulnerabilities before they get to production. GitLab's DevSecOps Platform allows users to perform security scans in CI/CD pipelines, which can easily be 
enabled to check applications for security vulnerabilities such as unauthorized access, data leaks, and denial of service (DoS) attacks.

## Introduction to Security Scanning

In today's software landscape, ensuring application security is critical. 

GitLab can check your application for security vulnerabilities including:
- Unauthorized access.
- Data leaks.
- Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

# Why Application Security Is Important

|                          | Privacy Risks | Ensure Code Quality | Data Protection |
|--------------------------|---------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Title**                | Privacy Risks | Ensure Code Quality | Data Protection |
| **Description**          | Similar to data protection, security scans help minimize privacy risks that could have a negative impact on your organization's reputation and customer trust. | Security scans help identify coding mistakes and security issues that may have been overlooked in the development process. | Without security scans, sensitive data is exposed to cyberattacks which can result in serious financial and legal consequences. |


## How does GitLab Address Security Concerns ?
GitLab offers multiple security scanners along with a variety of reporting and management features: 

| **Security Scanners** | **Security Support Features** |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **SAST (Static Application Security Testing)** – looks for known problems in source code (e.g., unvalidated user input leads to command injection). | **Security Reports** – show security vulnerabilities in different places and different ways. |
| **Secret Detection** – looks for hard-coded secrets in source code (e.g., passwords). | **Vulnerability Management** – lets you view problems in several places within GitLab and accept/dismiss/mark for action. |
| **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)** – passively or actively calls a web app or an API to look for security vulnerabilities. | **Policies** – provide security teams a way to require scans of their choice to be run whenever a project pipeline runs according to the configuration specified. |
| **IaC (Infrastructure-as-Code Scanning)** – scans IaC configuration files (e.g., Ansible, Terraform) for known security vulnerabilities. | |
| **Dependency Scanning** – looks at a project’s dependencies to see if there are known vulnerabilities with those versions (e.g., third-party YAML-parsing library). | |
| **Container Scanning** – looks at your project's Docker images and scans for known vulnerabilities. | |
| **Fuzz Testing** – sends random input to your functions, trying to cause unexpected problems (e.g., 200-character password or Klingon characters in Unicode). | |

## Introduction to Static Analysis
There are many different scanners that organizations can use to secure their applications. 
For the purpose of this introductory course, we'll just take a look at Static Application Security Testing (SAST) as it is the most often-used security scanner. 

### Static Analysis Use Cases
- Your code has a potentially dangerous attribute in a class, or unsafe code that can lead to unintended code execution.
- Your application is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks that can be leveraged to unauthorized access to session data.

If you’re using GitLab CI/CD, you can use Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to check your source code for known vulnerabilities. 
The analyzers output JSON-formatted reports as job artifacts.

SAST results are also processed so you can:
- See them in merge requests.
- Use them in approval workflows.
- Review them in the security dashboard.

## Introduction to Security Policies
Application security policies are a set of guidelines and procedures that ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data in software applications. 
By implementing these policies, organizations can protect sensitive information and mitigate the risk of security breaches. 
When setting up a security scanner, defining policies is how you tell the scanner what to flag and what to ignore.

GitLab supports the following security policies:

|                          | **Scan Execution Policy** | **Scan Result Policy** |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| **What is it?**          | Security Teams use scan execution policies to require vulnerability scans to be run, either on a specified schedule or as part of a pipeline job. <br/><br/> Scan execution policies enforce security scans for **particular branches at a certain time**. | Scan Result Policies allow Security Teams to enforce approval on a merge request when policy conditions are violated. For example, users can require approval on merge requests that introduce newly detected, critical vulnerabilities into their application. <br/><br/> Scan result policies ensure that security issues are checked **before merging a merge request**. |
| **Why is it important?** | Scan execution policies enforce a common set of security tool standards across projects. | Scan result policies prevent developers from accidentally or unintentionally committing out-of-compliance code to the codebase. |
| **Use Case Examples**    | Run a DAST scan with Scan Profile A and Site Profile A when a pipeline runs against the main branch. | If any scanner finds a newly detected critical vulnerability in an open merge request targeting the master branch, then require two approvals from any member of App security. |
| **What Scanners does it apply to?** | Static Analysis, Secret Detection, Container Scanning, Dependency Scanning, and Dynamic Analysis Scans | All scanners |
