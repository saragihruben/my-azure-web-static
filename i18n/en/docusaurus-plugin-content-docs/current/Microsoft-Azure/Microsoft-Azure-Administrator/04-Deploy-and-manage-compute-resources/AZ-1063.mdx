## Comparing Containers with Virtual Machines

Hardware virtualization allows running multiple isolated instances of operating systems simultaneously on the same physical hardware.  
Containers are the next stage in computing resource virtualization.

Container-based virtualization enables operating system virtualization. This approach allows users to run multiple applications within a single OS instance,  
while still maintaining isolation between applications. Containers inside virtual machines provide similar functionality as virtual machines inside physical servers.

### Things to Know About Containers vs Virtual Machines

To better understand container-based virtualization, let's compare containers and virtual machines.

| **Comparison**          | **Container**                                                                                          | **Virtual Machine**                                                                                                     |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Isolation**           | Provides lightweight isolation from the host and other containers, but not as strong as VMs' security boundaries. | Provides full isolation from the host OS and other VMs. Suitable when strong security boundaries are required, such as running apps from different companies on the same server or cluster. |
| **Operating System**    | Runs user mode parts of the OS and only loads services required by the application. More resource-efficient. | Runs a full OS including the kernel, requiring more CPU, memory, and storage resources.                                  |
| **Deployment**          | Can be run using Docker CLI. For many containers, use orchestrators like Azure Kubernetes Service.   | Can be run using Windows Admin Center or Hyper-V Manager. For many VMs, use PowerShell or System Center Virtual Machine Manager. |
| **Persistent Storage**  | Use Azure Disks for local node storage, or Azure Files (SMB share) for shared storage across nodes/servers. | Use virtual hard disk (VHD) for local VM storage, or SMB file shares for shared storage between servers.                 |
| **Fault Tolerance**     | If a cluster node fails, the orchestrator on another node immediately recreates containers that were running there. | VMs can failover to another server in the cluster, with their OS restarting on the new server.                           |

### Considerations When Using Containers

Containers offer several advantages over physical or virtual machines. Consider the following benefits and how you can apply containers for internal enterprise applications:

- **Flexibility and Speed**  
  Gain greater flexibility and faster development and distribution of containerized application code.

- **Testing**  
  Use containers to simplify application testing processes.

- **Application Deployment**  
  Use containers to accelerate and streamline application deployment.

- **Workload Density**  
  Support higher workload density and improve resource utilization by using containers.

## Azure Container Instances Overview

Containers are now the preferred method for packaging, deploying, and managing cloud applications. In Azure, there are many options to build and run cloud-native and container-based applications. One of the simplest and fastest options is **Azure Container Instances (ACI)**.

### What is Azure Container Instances?

**Azure Container Instances** provide the fastest and easiest way to run containers in Azure without managing virtual machines or using more complex services. ACI is ideal for scenarios that can run in isolated containers.

#### Understanding Container Images

All containers are created from **container images**, which are lightweight, standalone, executable software packages that include everything needed to run an application, including:

- **Code:** The application's source code.  
- **Runtime:** The environment required to run the application.  
- **System tools:** Essential utilities needed by the application.  
- **System libraries:** Shared libraries used by the application.  
- **Settings:** Application-specific configuration parameters.

Once created, a container image becomes a portable unit that runs consistently across different computing environments.

### Benefits of Azure Container Instances

Here are the main benefits of using Azure Container Instances for your internal applications:

- **Fast startup time**  
  Containers can run in seconds without needing to deploy or manage VMs.

- **Public IP and DNS connectivity**  
  Containers can be exposed directly to the internet using IP addresses and **FQDN** (Fully Qualified Domain Name).

- **Adjustable size**  
  Container resources can be dynamically scaled according to application needs.

- **Persistent storage**  
  ACI supports direct mounts to **Azure Files** for persistent data storage.

- **Support for Linux and Windows**  
  ACI can run Linux-based and Windows-based containers. Specify the OS type when creating a container group.

- **Coscheduled groups**  
  Supports scheduling multi-container groups sharing the same host machine resources.

- **Deployment to Virtual Network**  
  Containers can run inside an **Azure virtual network**, allowing better network control and security.

## Implementing Container Groups

A **Container Group** is a top-level resource in **Azure Container Instances (ACI)**. It is a collection of containers scheduled to run on the same host machine. Containers in one group share:

- Lifecycle  
- Resources (CPU, memory, GPU)  
- Local network  
- Storage volumes  

### Things to Know About Container Groups

- Container groups are similar to **pods** in Kubernetes.  
- Containers in one group can share related resources.  
- Azure sums the resource requirements of all containers in a group to allocate resources.  
- Two common ways to deploy multi-container groups:  
  - **ARM Template:** Suitable if you want to include other Azure resources (e.g., Azure Files).  
  - **YAML File:** More concise and suitable for container-only deployments.

#### Connectivity and IP

- Container groups can share a public IP address and ports, as well as DNS labels with **FQDN**.  
- To allow external access, ports must be exposed on both IP and containers.  
- **Port mapping is not supported** since all containers share the same port namespace.  
- When the container group is deleted, its IP and FQDN are also released.

#### Container Group Configuration Example

A multi-container group scenario with 2 containers:

- Runs on one host machine.  
- Has one DNS label and one public IP address.  
- Container 1 listens on port 80 (web app).  
- Container 2 listens on port 1433 (database).  
- Each container mounts an **Azure Files share** for persistent storage.

### Considerations When Using Container Groups

Container groups are useful when you want to split one app function into multiple containers. For example:

#### 1. **Web App Updates**  
- One container serves the web app.  
- A second container pulls the latest content from source control.

#### 2. **Log Collection**  
- The app writes logs to standard output.  
- A logging container reads the output and stores it in long-term storage.

#### 3. **App Monitoring**  
- A monitoring container accesses the app container regularly.  
- If issues arise, the monitoring container sends alerts.

#### 4. **Front-end and Back-end Support**  
- Front-end container serves the web UI.  
- Back-end container provides data services or APIs.

:::tip Conclusion  
Using **container groups** in ACI lets you manage related containers as one efficient, flexible, and scalable deployment unit.  
Ideal for modern microservices architectures and fast dev/test cloud needs.
