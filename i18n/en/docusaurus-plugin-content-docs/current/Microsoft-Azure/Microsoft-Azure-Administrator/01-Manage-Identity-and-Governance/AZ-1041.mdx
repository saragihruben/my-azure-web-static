## Microsoft Entra ID  
Microsoft Entra ID is a cloud-based directory service managed by **Microsoft (PaaS)** and is not part of the infrastructure owned and managed by customers.

### Microsoft Entra ID Features:
- Supports multi-factor authentication (MFA), identity protection, and self-service password reset.
- Used to configure access to applications, single sign-on (SSO), and Conditional Access.
- Can be used to manage users and groups, user provisioning, and cross-organization management.

:::info

**AD DS (Active Directory Domain Services)** is a directory service that provides methods to store directory data such as user accounts and passwords,  
and allows this data to be accessed by network users and administrators.

:::

Unlike AD DS, Microsoft Entra ID is designed as multi-tenant and  
specifically implemented to ensure isolation between organizational/tenant directories.

**Microsoft Entra Tenant:**
- Created for multi-tenancy and provides isolation between tenant directories.
- Each Azure subscription can only be associated with one Microsoft Entra tenant.
- Tenants can be used to manage resources using RBAC.

Each Microsoft Entra tenant is assigned a default Domain Name System (DNS) domain name, which consists of a prefix derived from the Microsoft account name  
used to create the Azure subscription or explicitly provided when creating the Microsoft Entra tenant, followed by the suffix **onmicrosoft.com**.

### Microsoft Entra Schema:
- The Microsoft Entra schema is simpler compared to AD DS and does not include **computer class**.
- Does not support **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)** or **organizational units (OUs)**.
- Microsoft Entra ID focuses more on identity management for web-based applications compared to AD DS which focuses on on-premises applications.

## Comparison Between Microsoft Entra ID and Active Directory Domain Services

:::info Key Differences:
- AD DS focuses on identity management for on-premises applications, while Microsoft Entra ID is designed for cloud applications.
- AD DS uses Kerberos and LDAP, whereas Microsoft Entra ID uses HTTP-based protocols like **SAML**, **OAuth**, and **OpenID Connect**.
- Microsoft Entra ID is better suited for internet-based applications, while AD DS is more for on-premises applications.

## Microsoft Entra Domain Services

Microsoft offers Microsoft Entra Domain Services as an alternative.  
Domain services such as Group Policy management, domain join, and Kerberos authentication are provided to Microsoft Entra tenants and are fully compatible  
with on-premises AD DS, without having to deploy and manage additional domain controllers in the cloud.

It can be deployed with Microsoft Entra Connect, allowing users to use their organizational credentials in both AD DS  
and Microsoft Entra Domain Services.

**Integration with On-Premises AD DS**
- Uses Microsoft Entra Connect.
- Users can use the same organizational credentials on-premises and in the cloud.
- Can be used without on-premises AD DS (cloud-only service).

**Benefits of Microsoft Entra Domain Services**
- No need to manage domain controllers.
- No need to manage AD replication.
- No need for Domain Admins/Enterprise Admins groups.
- Can migrate LDAP, NTLM, and Kerberos applications to the cloud.
- Can run SQL Server / SharePoint Server on Azure VMs without domain controllers or VPN.

**Cost**
- Charged hourly based on directory size.
- Enabled via the Azure Portal.
