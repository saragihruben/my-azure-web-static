## Monitoring and Azure Monitor

The goals of monitoring include:

- Ensuring applications and environments run optimally, securely, and reliably.
- Detecting and helping resolve arising issues.

#### Key monitoring activities:

- **Data collection**: Metrics, logs, and trace logs providing insights into the functionality and performance of monitored components.
- **Data analysis**: Understanding current conditions, predicting potential issues, and identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies.
- **Alerts**: Triggered when certain conditions are met, such as high CPU usage or low disk space.
- **Visualization**: Presenting data in an easily understandable visual format to enable quick system evaluation.
- **Diagnostics and troubleshooting**: Helping identify root causes and inform decisions for resolution.

#### Benefits of monitoring:

- **Performance and cost optimization**: Identifying performance bottlenecks and opportunities to increase efficiency.
- **Proactive management**: Preventing disruptions before they occur.
- **Reliability**: Enabling quick recovery during issues.
- **Capacity planning**: Analyzing usage patterns to support planning and scalability.
- **Security monitoring**: Detecting threats and suspicious activity.
- **Compliance and governance**: Ensuring adherence to standards and regulations.

### Azure Monitor Overview

When users run applications built on various services and resources, it's essential to connect application performance and health to the underlying components. This observability enables effective analysis and problem-solving.

**Azure Monitor** provides features and tools to collect, manage, and analyze IT data across Azure resources, other cloud services, and on-premises environments.

### Data Collection and Storage

Once users add resources to an Azure subscription, Azure Monitor begins data collection. Key features for data collection and management include:

- Native monitoring for all Azure implementations.
- Data collection agents and APIs for all stack layers (application and infrastructure, inside and outside Azure).
- Integration with Azure Event Hubs for streaming data.
- Ingestion-time data transformation to filter unnecessary data.
- Data retention configuration, archiving, and recovery options.
- Volume-based pricing discounts.
- Low-cost **Basic logs** tier for high-volume logs (debugging, auditing, troubleshooting) — not for analysis or alerts.

#### Data Analysis and Response

Azure Monitor offers tools to analyze and gain insights from monitoring data, including:

- User-friendly portal interface for viewing, filtering, and manipulating monitoring data.
- **Kusto Query Language (KQL)** — optimized for fast analysis and data exploration across sources.
- Tools for custom analysis, visualization, notifications, and response actions.
- Built-in alert recommendations.
- Ready-to-use monitoring experiences with advanced analytics and visualizations.
- **Autoscale** to adjust resources based on application load.
- Built-in **AI and machine learning** to detect and respond to anomalies.

### Alerts, Workbooks, and Visualization

Interactive monitoring is one way to observe applications. Another is to configure **alerts** to send text messages or emails to teams for investigation. Users can also trigger automated response actions.

#### Workbooks

Azure Monitor provides **workbooks**, flexible canvases for analyzing data and creating rich visual reports in the Azure portal. Workbooks can pull data from multiple Azure sources into unified, interactive views.

Users can:

- Use built-in workbooks from Azure Monitor.
- Create new workbooks from available templates.

![workbook](/img/az104/95.png)

Visualizations created in Azure Monitor can be added to **Azure dashboards**, enabling users to consolidate various data into a single view within the Azure portal.

## Metrics and Logs

### Metrics

**Metrics** are quantitative measurements representing a *snapshot* of application or resource performance. Typically numeric, they are recorded over time.

Metrics offer insight into aspects such as:

- Resource utilization
- Response times
- Error rates
- Throughput

Common metrics include:

- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Network latency
- Transaction rate

#### Accessing Metrics

Each resource type in Azure automatically provides a specific set of metrics.

Use **Azure Monitor Metrics Explorer** to:

- Interactively analyze metric data
- Create charts showing metric values over time

In the Azure portal:

1. Open the resource page.
2. Select **Metrics** under *Monitoring*.
3. Choose the desired metric from the dropdown menu.
4. Pin the chart to a dashboard if needed.

> **Example**: A line chart of *Requests* metric showing aggregated request counts for the Contoso-web-sales app.

#### Types of Metrics in Azure Monitor

Azure Monitor can collect several types of metrics, including:

- **Azure platform metrics**: Automatically collected when resources are added to a subscription.
- **Custom metrics**: From applications or agents on VMs. Sent via Azure Monitor Agent, extensions, or REST API.
- **Prometheus metrics**: Managed Azure Monitor for Prometheus collects metrics from AKS or other Kubernetes clusters. Supports integration with PromQL and Grafana.

Metrics are ideal for **real-time** monitoring and can trigger alerts when thresholds are reached.

### Logs

**Logs** are textual records of events, actions, and messages generated by resources or applications.

Unlike numeric metrics, logs can include:

- **Text**: Human-readable entries providing context and event descriptions.
- **Unstructured data**: Entries in non-standard formats.
- **Contextual info**: Insights into the state during the event — useful for root cause analysis.

Logs may record:

- Errors
- Warnings
- User actions
- Application status changes

Logs are critical for:

- Troubleshooting
- Debugging
- Retrospective event analysis

### Azure Monitor Logs

**Azure Monitor Logs** is a feature that allows storing, managing, and analyzing log and performance data from monitored resources.

#### Log Analytics Workspace

To start using logs:

1. Create a **Log Analytics workspace**.
2. Configure resources to send data to the workspace.

Once data is collected, users can explore and analyze logs via the interactive **Log Analytics** interface.

### Log Queries

Users can use **log queries** for multiple scenarios:

- Answer common questions using basic queries
- Perform complex data analysis to find critical patterns
- Use queries in alert rules for proactive notifications
- Display query results in workbooks or dashboards

Understanding **metrics and logs** helps users monitor applications and infrastructure in real-time and historically, and proactively respond to issues.

## Azure Monitor Insights, Visualizations, and Actions

Some Azure resource providers offer tailored visualizations for personalized monitoring experiences with minimal configuration. *Insights* are curated, scalable visualizations.
