## Azure Monitor  

Azure Monitor is a comprehensive monitoring platform used to:  
- Collect data from various sources (Azure, on-premises, or multi-cloud)  
- Analyze that data  
- Visualize information  
- Take automated actions based on analysis results  

Azure Monitor can monitor Azure resources, on-premises resources, and even resources from other cloud providers such as VMs in different clouds.

**How Does Azure Monitor Work?**

**1. Data Sources**  
Data is collected across all layers of application architectureâ€”from applications, operating systems, to networking.

**2. Data Storage**  
Logs and metrics are stored in a central repository.

**3. Data Usage**  
- Display real-time and historical performance  
- Show aggregated or detailed data  
- Presented via dashboards, Power BI, or Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries  
- Used to send notifications or perform auto-scaling based on thresholds  

<br/>
### Azure Log Analytics  
**Azure Log Analytics** is a tool in the Azure portal to write and run log queries on data collected by Azure Monitor.
It supports simple to complex queries, statistical analysis, and visualization of results. These queries can be used in other Azure Monitor features like:  
- Log-based alerts  
- Workbooks  
- Interactive dashboards  

<br/>
### Azure Monitor Alerts  
**Azure Monitor Alerts** is an automatic notification system that triggers when Azure Monitor detects certain conditions, such as threshold breaches.

**You can:**  
- Define trigger conditions  
- Configure notification actions  
- Associate with action groups like email, SMS, webhook, etc.

Example: Send an alert if VM CPU > 80%.

**Alerts can be based on:**  
- Metrics (real-time & numeric)  
- Logs (with complex logic and multiple sources)  

<br/>
### Application Insights  
**Application Insights** is a feature of Azure Monitor that monitors web applications running on:  
- Azure  
- On-premises servers  
- Other clouds  

**How to Configure:**  
- Use SDK integrated directly into the app  
- Or use the Application Insights Agent  

**What It Monitors:**  
- Request rates, response times, failure rates  
- External service dependencies  
- Page views and loading performance from user browsers  
- AJAX usage, user sessions, and server metrics (CPU, memory, network)  
- Synthetic requests to monitor apps when there is no real traffic
