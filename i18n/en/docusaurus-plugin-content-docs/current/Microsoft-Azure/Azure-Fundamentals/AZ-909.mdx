## Azure Policy

Azure Policy is a service that enables users to:  
- Create, assign, and manage policies  
- Control resource configurations  
- Ensure compliance with organizational standards  

### Purpose of Azure Policy

| üîê Azure Policy Function                        | üìã Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ‚úÖ Ensure configuration compliance of resources | Prevents or flags resources that do not comply with rules                     |
| üî¥ Prevent creation of non-compliant resources  | Example: prevent creation of certain VM sizes                                 |
| üõ†Ô∏è Automatically remediate non-compliant configurations | Example: automatically add missing tags                              |
| üïµÔ∏è Monitor & evaluate resources continuously    | Includes resources created before the policy was applied                      |
| üì¶ Integration with Azure DevOps               | Apply policies in CI/CD pipelines                                             |
<br/>

### How Azure Policy Works  
Policies can be applied to:  
- Resources  
- Resource groups  
- Subscriptions  
- Management groups  

**Policies are inheritable**  
For example, a policy assigned at the subscription level applies to all resource groups and resources beneath it.

#### What is an Azure Policy Initiative?  
**Initiative** = A collection of policies with a common goal  

**Purpose:** Simplifies management and compliance tracking at scale  

Example: Enable Monitoring in Azure Security Center, which includes over 100 policies to monitor vulnerabilities, encryption, and server protection.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Using Resource Locks

**Resource Lock** is used to prevent accidental deletion or modification of important Azure resources.

:::warning  
Even with **Azure RBAC**, users with high permissions such as Owner can delete resources. Resource Locks provide extra protection in such cases.  
:::

<br/>
### Types of Resource Locks

| üîí Lock Type     | üîß Function                                                                 |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CanNotDelete`   | Users can read & modify, but **cannot delete** the resource                 |
| `ReadOnly`       | Users can **only read**. Cannot modify or delete                            |
<br/>

**Where Can Resource Locks Be Applied?**  
- Individual Resource  
- Resource Group  
- Subscription  

**Locks are inheritable:**  
If a lock is applied at the resource group level, all resources within it are also locked.

**How to Manage Resource Locks**  
You can manage locks through:  
- Azure Portal (Settings menu on the resource)  
- PowerShell  
- Azure CLI  
- ARM Template (Azure Resource Manager)  

**How to Modify Locked Resources?**  
- Remove the lock first  
- Perform the desired action (delete/modify resource)  

:::warning  
Even as an **Owner** of a resource or resource group, you **must remove the lock** before making changes.  
:::

:::info Benefits of Resource Locks

- Protection against accidental deletion or modification  
- Ensures stability of critical services  
- Provides peace of mind when multiple teams access the cloud  
- Can be used alongside Azure Policy and RBAC
