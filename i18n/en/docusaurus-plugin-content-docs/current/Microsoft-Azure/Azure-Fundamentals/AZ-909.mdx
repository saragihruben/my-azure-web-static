**Purpose:** Simplifies management and compliance tracking at scale  

Example: Enable Monitoring in Azure Security Center, which includes over 100 policies to monitor vulnerabilities, encryption, and server protection.

## Using Resource Locks

**Resource Lock** is used to prevent accidental deletion or modification of important Azure resources.

:::warning  
Even with **Azure RBAC**, users with high permissions such as Owner can delete resources. Resource Locks provide extra protection in such cases.

### Types of Resource Locks

**Where Can Resource Locks Be Applied?**  
- Individual Resource  
- Resource Group  
- Subscription  

**Locks are inheritable:**  
If a lock is applied at the resource group level, all resources within it are also locked.

**How to Manage Resource Locks**  
You can manage locks through:  
- Azure Portal (Settings menu on the resource)  
- PowerShell  
- Azure CLI  
- ARM Template (Azure Resource Manager)  

**How to Modify Locked Resources?**  
- Remove the lock first  
- Perform the desired action (delete/modify resource)  

:::warning  
Even as an **Owner** of a resource or resource group, you **must remove the lock** before making changes.

:::info Benefits of Resource Locks

- Protection against accidental deletion or modification  
- Ensures stability of critical services  
- Provides peace of mind when multiple teams access the cloud  
- Can be used alongside Azure Policy and RBAC
