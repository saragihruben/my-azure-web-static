## Physical Infrastructure

Azure has a physical infrastructure that includes **datacenters**, **regions**, **availability zones**, and **region pairs**. This infrastructure is designed to provide reliable, fast, and secure cloud services to users.

<br/>
### Azure Regions

A region is a geographic area that contains one or more data centers with low-latency network connectivity. Every resource created in Azure must be placed in a specific region.

:::info Key Fact:
Some services are only available in specific regions, such as certain VM types or storage options.  
Some global Azure services do not require region selection, such as **Microsoft Entra ID**, **Azure Traffic Manager**, and **Azure DNS**.
:::

<br/>
### Availability Zones

Availability Zones are physically separate data centers within a single Azure region. Each zone has independent power, cooling, and networking, so if one zone fails, others continue to operate.

**Availability Zones are useful for:**
- Enhancing application reliability through data and service replication  
- Supporting services like VMs, managed disks, load balancers, and SQL databases  
- May increase cost due to inter-zone replication  

<br/>
### Region Pairs

Most Azure regions are paired with another region in the same geography (at least 300 miles apart). Main function: Resource replication to reduce the risk of major outages such as natural disasters or power failures.

**Advantages of Region Pairs:**
- Automatic failover if one region experiences a major disruption  
- Azure updates paired regions one at a time to reduce downtime  
- Data remains within the same legal jurisdiction (except Brazil South)

**Examples of Region Pairs:**
- West US ↔ East US  
- Southeast Asia ↔ East Asia

However, some regions do not have bidirectional pairing, such as West India & Brazil South.

<br/>
### Sovereign Regions

Azure has specific isolated regions for legal and regulatory compliance.

- **Azure Government** (US DoD, US Gov Virginia, etc.): Used by US government agencies with enhanced security.  
- **Azure China** (China East, China North, etc.): Managed by 21Vianet, not directly by Microsoft.

<br/>
:::tip Conclusion
- Azure has a global network of data centers across multiple regions  
- Availability Zones ensure services continue even if a specific zone fails  
- Region Pairs protect data from major disasters with automatic failover  
- Sovereign Regions are designed to meet specific legal and regulatory requirements

## Management Infrastructure

The management infrastructure includes **Azure resources**, **resource groups**, **subscriptions**, and **accounts**.

### Azure Resources

Azure resources are the basic building blocks in Azure. Anything created, provisioned, or deployed in Azure is considered a resource, such as:  
- Virtual Machines (VMs)  
- App Services  
- Networking components  
- Databases (SQL Server)  
- Azure Functions  

<br/>
### Resource Groups

A resource group is a container that holds related resources in Azure. When creating resources, users must assign them to a resource group.

**Key Facts About Resource Groups:**
- A resource can belong to only one resource group.  
- Some resources can be moved to another resource group, but once moved, they are no longer associated with the previous group.  
- Resource groups cannot be nested.

**Benefits of Resource Groups:**
- **Bulk Deletion** – Deleting a resource group deletes all resources inside it.  
- **Access Control** – Permissions granted to a resource group apply to all its resources.  
- **Project Structuring** – For example, grouping all project-related resources together for easier deletion after project completion.

<br/>
### Azure Subscriptions

Azure subscriptions are used for managing, billing, and scaling resources. Like resource groups, subscriptions help organize both resources and resource groups.

To use Azure, a user must have an Azure subscription, which provides authenticated and authorized access to Azure products and services.

**Types of Subscription Limits:**

- **Billing Limitations** – Determines how an Azure account is billed. Having multiple subscriptions allows for separate billing reports.  
- **Access Control Boundaries** – Access management policies can be applied at the subscription level, helping manage access based on organizational structure.

:::info Why Create Multiple Subscriptions?

- **Environment Separation** – E.g., one subscription for production, another for development.  
- **Organizational Structure** – Each department can have its own subscription with specific policies.  
- **Cost Management** – Grouping resources by project or department improves cost tracking.

:::

<br/>
### Azure Management Groups

![Docusaurus logo](/img/az900/4.png)

If a user has many subscriptions, a more efficient way is needed to manage access, policies, and compliance across them. Azure Management Groups form a hierarchy above subscriptions, allowing broad policy and access control.

- All subscriptions in a management group automatically inherit its policies and access rules.  
- Management groups can be nested, allowing grouping by teams, departments, or other specific needs.

**Examples of Using Management Groups:**

- **Policy Enforcement** – E.g., restrict VM deployment to specific regions within a group named “Production.”  
  All subscriptions underneath will inherit this policy automatically.

- **Access Across Subscriptions** – Grouping multiple subscriptions under one management group allows you  
  to apply access rules once, without repeating them for each subscription.

<br/>
:::info Key Facts About Management Groups:
- Supports up to 10,000 management groups per directory.  
- Management group hierarchy can be up to 6 levels deep.  
- Each management group and subscription can have only one parent.
:::

<br/>

:::tip Conclusion
- Resources are the basic unit in Azure, organized into resource groups for easier management.  
- Azure subscriptions help structure resources and resource groups for cost and budgeting purposes.  
- Management groups provide centralized control over subscriptions for unified policy and access enforcement.
