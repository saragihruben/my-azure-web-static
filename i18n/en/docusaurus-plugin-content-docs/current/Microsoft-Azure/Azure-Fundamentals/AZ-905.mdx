## Azure Virtual Machine
Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) are an **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** offering that allows users to create and run virtual machines in the cloud.  
Like physical computers, users can install operating systems, applications, and configure settings as needed.

#### When to Use Azure VMs?
Azure VMs are suitable when you need:

- Full control over the operating system (OS).
- Ability to run custom software.
- Customizable hosting configurations.

With Azure VMs, users get virtualization flexibility without purchasing and maintaining physical hardware,  
but remain responsible for managing, updating, and maintaining the software running on the VM.

### Azure VMs Scalability
You can run a single VM for testing or development, or group multiple VMs to achieve **high availability**, **scalability**, and **redundancy**.

**Virtual Machine Scale Sets**
- Enable automatic creation and management of identical VM groups.
- VMs can scale out or in automatically based on demand.
- Include automatic load balancing for resource efficiency.
- Suitable for big data, container workloads, and large-scale computing.

**Virtual Machine Availability Sets**
- Designed to improve application resilience and availability.
- Help prevent total failure due to network or power outages.
- Two main mechanisms:
    - Update Domain: Groups VMs for phased updates.
    - Fault Domain: Separates VMs by resources and network to avoid total failure.

- No additional cost for using Availability Sets; you pay only for the VMs used.

<br/>
:::info When to Use Azure VMs? (Use Cases)
- Testing & Development: Helps developers quickly test applications across various OS and software configurations.
- Running Applications in the Cloud: Provides more flexibility than traditional infrastructure.
- Extending Data Centers to the Cloud: Connects Azure VMs with on-premises networks to increase capacity.
