title: Features and Tools on Azure Cloud for Managing and Deploying Azure Resources
---

## Tools

To effectively manage your Azure environment, Microsoft provides several tools you can use depending on your preference or needs:

**1. Azure Portal:**  
A web-based portal with a graphical UI to manage all Azure resources.

**Key Features:**  
- Create and manage resources visually  
- Monitor usage and service performance  
- Create custom dashboards  
- Access directly without installation — just a browser!

**Advantages:**  
Great for beginners or anyone who prefers working visually.

<br/>
**2. Azure Cloud Shell:**  
A browser-based shell within the Azure Portal that supports:  
- Azure PowerShell  
- Azure CLI (Bash)

**Key Features:**  
- No local installation needed  
- Automatically connected to your Azure account  
- Save files/scripts in Azure Files  
- Quick access: Click the Cloud Shell icon at the top of the Azure Portal  

<br/>
**3. Azure PowerShell:**  
A PowerShell-based tool for managing Azure via scripts or command line (cmdlets).

**Functions:**  
- Automate deployments  
- Setup and maintain infrastructure  
- Ideal for Windows users and PowerShell scripting  
- Available on: Windows, macOS, Linux, and Azure Cloud Shell  

<br/>
**4. Azure CLI:**  
A Bash-based tool with similar functions to Azure PowerShell but uses Bash syntax.

**Functions:**  
- Manage resources via command line  
- Suitable for Linux/macOS users or those familiar with Bash  
- Available on: Windows, macOS, Linux, and Cloud Shell

## Azure Arc

**Azure Arc** is Microsoft’s solution for centrally and consistently managing **hybrid** and **multi-cloud** environments,  
as if all those resources were inside Azure.

When you have on-premises resources or resources in other clouds (like AWS or Google Cloud),  
**Azure Arc** lets you connect and manage those resources via **Azure Resource Manager (ARM)**.

#### Benefits of Azure Arc

- Unifies management of resources across on-premises and multi-cloud into a single Azure management platform.  
- Projects non-Azure resources into Azure so they can be managed like Azure resources.  
- Uses familiar Azure tools and services like Azure Policy, Azure Monitor, and Security Center—for all resources regardless of location.  
- Combines traditional IT operations (ITOps) with DevOps practices, suitable for various teams and organizations.  
- Defines custom locations on Azure Arc–enabled Kubernetes clusters for more flexible management.

Currently, Azure Arc supports management of several types of non-Azure resources, including:  
- Physical servers (on-premises or other clouds)  
- Kubernetes clusters  
- Azure Data Services (e.g., Azure SQL Managed Instance, PostgreSQL Hyperscale)  
- SQL Server  
- Virtual Machines (in preview)

## Azure Resource Manager

**Azure Resource Manager (ARM)** is the management and deployment service for Azure resources.  
ARM acts as the management layer that handles all requests sent through the Azure portal, CLI, PowerShell, SDK, or API.

Whenever you create, delete, or update a resource in Azure—all requests go through **ARM**.

**Key Benefits of ARM:**  
- Manage infrastructure declaratively using templates  
- Group resources in a package for easier management  
- Redeploy with consistent results  
- Define dependencies between resources to ensure correct deployment order  
- Manage access (RBAC) and tag resources for management and cost tracking  
- Monitor costs based on tags or resource groups  

**ARM Template**  
An ARM Template is a JSON file that declaratively describes the infrastructure.  
You simply state what you want to create, and Azure handles how to create it.

### Advantages of ARM Templates

### Bicep  
Bicep is a simpler, more concise language compared to ARM JSON templates.  
It is also declarative but easier to read and write.

**Bicep Advantages:**  
- Simpler and cleaner syntax  
- Full support for all Azure resource types  
- Idempotent — can be deployed multiple times with the same outcome  
- Highly modular — can be created into reusable code blocks  

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**  
With Infrastructure as Code, you can:  
- Manage infrastructure with code  
- Store versions in Git  
- Automate deployment processes  
- Reduce manual errors
