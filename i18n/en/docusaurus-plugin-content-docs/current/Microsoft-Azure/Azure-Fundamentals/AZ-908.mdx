## Factors Affecting Costs on Azure

### Resource Types  
Costs depend on:  
- Type of resources (VMs, Storage, etc.)  
- Configuration (performance tier, redundancy, region)  
- Deployment location  

Example:  
- Storage accounts in Europe vs Asia can have different costs.  
- VMs with more cores and certain OS licenses are more expensive.  

### Consumption (Pay-as-you-go)  
Pay based on usage. More usage means higher cost; less usage means lower cost.  
Discount options:  
- Usage commitment (1 or 3 years)  
- Up to 72% discount for reserved resources  

### Maintenance  
Keep your cloud environment tidy:  
- Deprovision unused resources  
- Use resource groups for better organization  
- Monitor VMs, storage, and network to match demand  

### Geography  
Location impacts cost:  
- Electricity, taxes, and labor costs vary  
- Storage or VMs in the US may be cheaper than in Japan  
- Regional data transfer is more cost-effective  

Example: Data transfer from Europe to Asia costs more than transfers within Europe.  

### Network Traffic (Bandwidth)  
- Inbound data transfer to Azure is usually free  
- Outbound data transfer is charged per zone  
- Zone = a group of Azure regions for billing purposes  

### Subscription Types  
Some subscriptions include:  
- Free Trial: 12 months of free products + 30-day initial credit  
- Access to 25+ always free products (depends on region and capacity)  

### Azure Marketplace  
Buy third-party solutions like:  
- Servers with pre-installed software  
- Managed firewalls  
- Third-party backup connectors  

:::info Note:  
Costs include:  
- Azure services  
- Third-party vendor services  

All products are certified per Azure standards and policies.

## Comparing Pricing and Total Cost of Ownership Calculators

### Pricing Calculator  
**Purpose:**  
Provide an estimated cost for provisioning Azure resources.  

**Key Features:**  
- Estimates for single resources or full solutions  
- Supports various example scenarios  
- Can estimate compute, storage, networking, and redundancy costs  

:::warning Note:  
- Does not deploy real resources  
- For information & estimation only  
- No charges when adding resources  
:::

**Usage Example:**  
Simulate costs when running a VM with premium storage and high redundancy in the Southeast Asia region.  

### Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator  
**Purpose:**  
Compare costs of running on-premises infrastructure vs. Azure Cloud.  

**Key Features:**  
Input your current infrastructure configuration:  
- Servers  
- Databases  
- Storage  
- Outbound traffic  

Add assumptions like electricity and IT labor costs.  

**Output:**  
TCO calculator shows estimated cost difference between:  
- Your current on-premises environment and Azure Cloud environment with equivalent infrastructure needs

## Microsoft Cost Management Tool

Microsoft Cost Management is an Azure service to help monitor, control, and optimize cloud spending. It is especially useful when:  
- Resources are provisioned rapidly (intentionally or not)  
- Costs balloon unnoticed  
- You want to budget and avoid surprises on invoices  

<br/>  
### Cost Analysis  
Use Cost Analysis to:  
- View total costs by:  
  - Billing cycle  
  - Region  
  - Resource type, etc.  
- Analyze spending trends monthly, quarterly, or yearly  
- Visualize organizational spending to identify biggest cost sources  

**Example:**  
You might see that 70% of costs come from storage in East Asia.  

<br/>  
### Cost Alerts  
One place to see all types of cost alerts.  

**Alert Types:**  

**1. Budget Alerts**  
- Triggered when spending reaches a set threshold  
- Created via Azure portal or Azure Consumption API  
- Can be based on cost or usage  

**2. Credit Alerts**  
- For Enterprise Agreement (EA) customers  
- Sent automatically when credits reach 90% and 100%  

**3. Department Spending Quota Alerts**  
- Warns when department spending approaches or exceeds limits  
- Example: 75% quota reached â†’ email alert sent  

<br/>  
### Budgets  
**What is a budget?** A spending limit set on:  
- Subscription  
- Resource group  
- Service type, and more  

**Advanced Features:**  
- **Automatic triggers** when limits are hit (e.g., shut down resources or send notifications)  
- **Email alerts** for teams or account owners  

**Example Usage:**  
Set a monthly budget of Rp10 million. When spending hits Rp9 million, system sends email and dashboard alerts.

## Using Tags

**What is a Tag?**  
Tags are additional metadata you can attach to Azure resources. Each tag is a key-value pair.  
Tags are not inherited automatically by resource groups or subscriptions, giving you high flexibility in how you assign them.  

**Why Are Tags Important?**  
As your cloud usage grows, organized management is key to cost control and efficiency.  
Tags make it easier to track, group, and manage resources based on various criteria.  

### Key Benefits of Tags on Azure Resources  
![Docusaurus logo](/img/az900/14.png)  

<br/>  
**How to Manage Tags?**  
Tags can be managed via:  
- Azure Portal  
- Azure CLI  
- PowerShell  
- ARM Template  
- REST API  

**Use Azure Policy to:**  
- Enforce tagging on provisioning  
- Standardize naming conventions  
- Recover missing tags  

### Example Tag Usage  
![Docusaurus logo](/img/az900/15.png)  

:::warning  
Not all resources need every tag. For example, only critical resources might have an "Impact" tag.  
:::

:::info Conclusion  
- Tags = Flexible metadata for Azure resources  
- Helps with cost management, compliance, automation, & visibility  
- Can be used to enforce organizational standards and automate cloud management
