## Azure Storage Accounts

Azure Storage Account provides a unique namespace for your Azure Storage data, accessible globally via HTTP or HTTPS.  
Data in this account is secure, highly available, durable, and very flexible.

### Types of Storage Accounts and Redundancy Options  
When creating a storage account, you can choose the account type that determines the storage services, redundancy options, and use cases.

**Redundancy Options:**  
1. Locally Redundant Storage (LRS):  
Stores three copies of data within a single Azure region.

2. Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS):  
Stores data across multiple zones within a single region.

3. Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS):  
Stores data in two different Azure regions (primary and secondary).

4. Read-Access Geo-Redundant Storage (RA-GRS):  
Same as GRS but allows read access to the secondary region.

5. Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage (GZRS):  
Combination of ZRS and GRS for maximum durability.

6. Read-Access Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage (RA-GZRS):  
GZRS with read access to the secondary region.

### Storage Account Endpoints  
Every Azure Storage Account has a unique namespace. Account names must:  
- Be 3-24 characters long  
- Contain only lowercase letters and numbers  
- Be unique across Azure

## Azure Storage Redundancy

Azure Storage always keeps multiple copies of data to protect against hardware failures, network issues, power outages, and natural disasters.  
Redundancy ensures data availability and durability even during failures.

**1. Choosing Redundancy Options**

When selecting redundancy options, consider:  
- How data is replicated within the primary region.  
- Whether data is replicated to a geographically distant secondary region.  
- Whether the application requires read access to data in the secondary region if the primary is unavailable.

<br/>
**2. Redundancy in the Primary Region**

Every Azure Storage account automatically stores three copies of data within the primary region.

  a. Locally Redundant Storage (LRS)  
  - Stores 3 copies of data in a single data center in the primary region.  
  - Durability of 99.999999999% (11 nines) per year.  
  - Lowest cost but vulnerable to disasters affecting the entire data center.

  b. Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS)  
  - Stores 3 copies of data across 3 availability zones in the primary region.  
  - Durability of 99.9999999999% (12 nines) per year.  
  - More resilient than LRS, remains available even if one zone fails.  
  - Recommended for applications requiring high availability.

<br/>
**3. Redundancy in the Secondary Region**

For higher durability, data can be replicated to a secondary region hundreds of miles from the primary.

  a. Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS)  
  - Stores 3 copies of data in the primary region (LRS) and asynchronously replicates to the secondary region (LRS).  
  - Durability of 99.99999999999999% (16 nines) per year.  
  - Secondary region is only accessible after failover.

  b. Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage (GZRS)  
  - Combines ZRS in the primary region with LRS replication in the secondary region.  
  - Provides high availability plus protection against regional disasters.  
  - Suitable for apps requiring maximum consistency, durability, and performance.

<br/>
**4. Read Access to Secondary Region**

By default, data in the secondary region cannot be read or written until failover occurs.  
- Read-Access Geo-Redundant Storage (RA-GRS) → Enables read access to data in the secondary region.  
- Read-Access Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage (RA-GZRS) → Same as RA-GRS but uses GZRS.

:::info  
**Important Note:**  
Because replication to the secondary region is asynchronous, there is a risk of data loss if the primary region fails before replication completes.  
:::

:::tip Conclusion  
- LRS → Cheapest, protects only against hardware failure.  
- ZRS → Protects against zone failure within the primary region.  
- GRS & GZRS → Protect against regional disasters via secondary region replication.  
- RA-GRS & RA-GZRS → Allow read access to secondary region before failover.  

The best option depends on cost, availability, and **Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR)** needs.
